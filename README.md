- The bash script provides the user with a selection menu of services provided by the salon.
- The associated database has tables to store customers, services, and appointments.
- Once a user selects a salon service to book, the script asks the user for a phone number.
- If the phone number belongs to an existing customer in the database, that customer's information is used to save the user's requested service and appointment time.
- If the phone number is not in the database, the user is prompted for their name.
- The new number and name are stored in the customer database.
